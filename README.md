This program will prompt the user to enter their name, bio, skills, and scales. It will then create a resume in a PDF format with the provided information and a visualization of the skills based on the scales in a separate bar chart with a futuristic and professional color scheme. The resume will be saved as a PDF file.

In terminal shell,

  pip install fpdf
